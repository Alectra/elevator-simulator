# elevator-simulator
An AngularJS component-based application of an elevator simulator.

* See image for initial mockup and my personal notes.

### The Project:
Youâ€™re designing the software that simulates elevators in a building.
Design a set of objects that will manage elevator movement and interaction between the
elevators. The elevator simulation should support these features:
  1. Initialize the elevator simulation with the desired number of elevators, and the desired
number of floors. Assume ground/min of 1.
  2. Each elevator will report as is moves from floor to floor.
  3. Each elevator will report when it opens or closes its doors.
  4. An elevator cannot proceed above the top floor.
  5. An elevator cannot proceed below the ground floor (assume 1 as the min)
  6. An elevator request can be made at any floor, to go to any other floor.
  7. When an elevator request is made, the unoccupied elevator closest to it will answer the
call, unless an occupied elevator is moving and will pass that floor on its way. The
exception is that if an unoccupied elevator is already stopped at that floor, then it will
always have the highest priority answering that call.
  8. The elevator should keep track of how many trips it has made, and how many floors it
has passed. The elevator should go into maintenance mode after 100 trips, and stop
functioning until serviced, therefore not be available for elevator calls.

### Design thoughts:
1. There will be a main elevator controller which tells the elevators what to do and keeps track of them.
2. It shouldn't have problems scaling up to as many floors and elevators as desired, but maximums would be easy to implement.
