# elevator-simulator
An AngularJS component-based application of an elevator simulator.

* See image for initial mockup and my personal notes.

### The Project:
Follow technical specs provided to create the app.

### Design thoughts:
1. There will be a main elevator controller which tells the elevators what to do and keeps track of them.
2. It shouldn't have problems scaling up to as many floors and elevators as desired, but maximums would be easy to implement.
